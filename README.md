# Search Engine

This project is a compact implementation of a search engine employing a crawler to traverse specified websites. The crawler operates on a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, systematically navigating through links discovered within the crawled pages. Upon crawling each page, the system extracts its content, indexes it using Elasticsearch, and proceeds to explore additional links within the page.
